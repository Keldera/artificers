# Impact
Impact is an extensive overhaul for Minecraft's combat.
It is intended for Impact to be stand-alone, but support as much cross-mod interaction as possible. 

## Planned Features:
- Ability to add extra functionality to Minecraft's (and mods') tool types.
- Ability to process different types & lengths of inputs. Single-tap, repeat-tap, hold, release, etc.
- A "Content Pack" system that allows modders and users alike to make their own variations and abilities for items.
- A default, disable-able Content Pack which contains the behaviors of the Vanilla tool types as I would make them.
